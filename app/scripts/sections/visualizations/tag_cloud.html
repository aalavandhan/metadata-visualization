        This visualization leverages Elasticsearch term aggregations to fetch the
        top 1000 most occurring entities for a given file type. While performing NER
        on the trec polar dataset not only identify entities but also the number of times
        they occur in each document. The <i>Aggregation Type</i> filter aggregates entities
        based on the number of times they've occurred through the dataset ( or ) based on the number of documents in which they've occurred. We also use elasticsearch's inherent
        tokenization mechanism to aggregate entities in their actual / tokenized form.
