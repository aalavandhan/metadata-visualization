      <h3>TF-IDF Scores for Sweet terms</h3>

      <p>
        We computed the TF-IDF scores for the sweet terms from the corpus of PDF documents to examine sweet terms with High / Low TF-IDF scores. This visualizations is more informative than naive count estimation as it can be used to eliminate irrelevant features. We computed these scores offline. We generated scores for each sweet term in the PDF corpus.
